# BASICS-OF-C-
Hello World: This part of the program demonstrates the fundamental structure of a C++ application. It includes the #include <iostream> directive to enable input and output operations and a main function where the std::cout statement is used to print "Hello, World!" to the console.

Calculator: This section shows a basic arithmetic calculator. The program prompts the user to enter two numbers and select an operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then performs the chosen operation and displays the result.

Overall, this program illustrates how to write and execute a simple C++ application, covering essential concepts such as input/output, variables, and basic control structures.
